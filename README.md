This repository is for the different JS projects I will be building as I learn and understand the programming language, writing efficient, clean, and optimized code while building practical projects along the way.

### Learning Modules

- **Basics of JavaScript**: Fundamentals of the language, including variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Intermediate Concepts**: Functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and more.
- **Advanced Topics**: ES6 features, closures, promises, modules, and design patterns.
